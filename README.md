# Quick repro of JIT portal issue

Use deployment button to deploy repro:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fneilpeterson%2Fjit-portal-issue-repro%main.json)

# Observations

With this deployment, two virtual machines are created with the following attributes:

- Both are connected to a single VNET and a single subnet
- A NSG is attached to the subnet
- A second NSG per VM is attached to the VMs NIC
- A JIT rule is created for each VM (two in total)

One complete, we can see that the two JIT rules have been created. In the below screenshot, we can see a JIT rule for both VMs (JIT-VM-001 and JIT-VM-002).

However, when navigating to the VMs through the Azure portal, only one appears to be JIT enabled (JIT-VM-001). Whereas JIT-VM-002 does not appear to be JIT enabled.

That said, when looking at networking for JIT-VM-002, we can see the JIT created rule to deny management port access. So that looks good.

If using PowerShell against JIT-VM-002 to request JIT access, the request is successful, and the expected allow NSG rule has been created.

And, the expected allow NSG rule has been created.

## Conclusion

To me, this looks like a portal / UI bug. I have tested in both the preview and non-preview portal, and this persists across both.
